writing of Paris himself. That it was the first tran·
script would appear evident from the fact, that those
which appear as marginal variatione in this are in the
Cotton manuscript embodied in the text3 at the same
time that a few passages occurring in it, which ere not
found in the other, might justify ns in the belief that
they were both executed in the lifetime of Paris him·
self.

From the foregoing statement therefore it would ap·
pear, that we bave from a comparison of these mann·
scripts the complete history of the lahonrs of Matthew
Paris. We have, in the first place, the text of his
predecessor left almost in its original state, so much
so indeed as not even to need a fresh transcript of
the Chronicle, since the margin and a few interpolated
leaves are sufficient for the purpose In the next place,
we have from the year 1189 a fresh transcript, or rather
new volume, called for hythe additional matter to be
inserted and corrections to he made; again, this having

⁸ been corrected with dne care, still hythe author himself,
we have the more perfect form, as far as an uninter·

rupted text can make it so, in the complete transcript
as aliorded ns by the Cotton manuscript; and beyond all
this we have Paris' very autograph obsidpmetf of, or
compilation from, the whole, as exhibited in the His·
toria Minor, now preserved in the old Royal collection
of MSS. in the British Musenm.
