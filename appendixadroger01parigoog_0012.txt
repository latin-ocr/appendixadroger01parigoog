how is it proved that Wendover wrote the remaindert
For an answer to this question the reader is referred
to the Preface of this edition, where, in addition to the
arguments adduced in his hehalf, may bc added further
the mode of dividing the work, as it is recognized in
the compiler's prologus, as also the tacit acknow·
ledgment of Paris himself, in suffering to he inserted
on the margin cf his new volume‚¹ at the time when
Wendover terminated his labours, the note following,
‘Huc usque scripsit cronica dominus Rogerus de Wen·
dovre‚' etc.

In preparing the present volume, the Editor has been
v carcful to preserve every important variation with which
an accurate collation of the text with Wats' edition of
Matthew Paris and the Variantes Lectiones of that editor
could fnrnish him. He has also, in any doubtful case,
sought assistance from the MSS. to which allusion has
hoen before made. At the same time that he has not
thought it necessary to preserve every trifling deviation
from the original, which, although highly important in
many cases in editing the classical writers of Rome and
Greece, can yet he hut of little real value in an his-
torian writing at a period when elegance of style was,
comparatively speaking, little cultivated. The varia-
tions to which allusion is here made are such as the
reading namnum for iu perpacata, aad for praet, ie
fingam emes for reliquos ic sugam, etc, altemating very
much on the side of either historian. 'Phe additions,
however, are everywhere introduced, and any marked
difference of style preserved. The following introduc·
tory chapters cf the Historia Minor are here appended,
in order tc convey to the reader some idea of the mode
adopted hy Paris in the composition of that highly
interesting Chronicle.
