since, with the exception ol the Cecil MS. erroneously
stated by Wats as being deposited in tbe C.C.C.
Library, Cambridge, no otber copy ol tbe Historia
Minoris known to have existed. That the Cecil MS.
did contaiu the lesser chronicle is clear from the various
readings given by Wats attha end of the printed edi·
tions ol Paris, all differing much srom the present re-
ceived text, aud agreeing verbatim with the Royal MS.
interesting, however, as this manuscript is on its own
account, it becomes even more valuable from the light
which, as the autograph of Paris, it throws upon the
question os the authenticity of Wendover's history.
From a comparison of it with the Cambridge manu·
script, the innovatione, whether by correction or ad·
dition, ol Matthew Paris may be mceuained with the
most minute accuracy3 sor in the first volume ol the
latter MS, extending to the year 1189,ι the additions
sometimes on the margin, at others by insertion of new
leaves, at others again by erasures written over, are all
by precisely the same hand. The volume spoken of
appears, in lact, to be the very copy of Wendover’s
Chronicle, or the Great chronicles of St. Albau’s, used
by Paris as the foundation of bis Historia Major,-
tbe ⁴ copy’ as it were from which bis amended text vvas
to be transcribed. The second volume is by altogether
a different and a somevvhat later haud. The text is
no longer Wendover’s, but, as it vvould seem, the tran·
script of Paris' ‘first editiou' of that chronicler, and it
is remarkable that it is apparently in the same hand·
writing with that of the Cotton MS. in the British
Museum. Still, the textos Wendover is not altogether
lest, and additions and erasures continue iu the baud·

¹ At the eud ol the year llas, in usque Mannum Domini hic nonum?
the MS. oi the Historia Minor, occurs where allusion is evidently made to
the following note on the margin, the Cambridge MS„ as is probably
‘Hec est vera eontramio historie Ma· intended also in the marginal note at
thei Parisiensiain primo volumine, in the nme point oi time in the MS. oi
qno habetur historia ab origine mundi Wendover.
